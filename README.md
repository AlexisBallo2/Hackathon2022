# Middlebury Hackathon 2022
## Midd XChange

This website seeks to foster further interconnectedness in the Middlebury community. Using this website, students will be able to list items (ie bike), and choose to rent it out for an hourly rate. This will allow students to gain access to resources they may not have hd access to previously.
